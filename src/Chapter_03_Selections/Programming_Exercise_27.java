 * Geometry: points in triangle?
 * Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as shown below. 
 * The right-angle point is placed at (0, 0), and the other two points are placed at (200, 0), 
 * and (0, 100). Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point with x- and y-coordinates 
 * and determines whether the point is inside the triangle.
