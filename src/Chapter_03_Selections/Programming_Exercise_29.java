/**
 * Geometry: two circles
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center coordinates and radii of two circles 
 * and determines whether the second circle is inside the first or overlaps with the first, as shown in Figure 3.10. 
 * (Hint: circle2 is inside circle1 if the distance between the two centers 6 = |r1 - r2| 
 * and circle2 overlaps circle1 if the distance between the two centers <= r1 + r2. 
 * Test your program to cover all cases.)
