 * Game: Eight Queens
 * The classic Eight Queens puzzle is to place eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other 
 * (i.e., no two queens are on the same row, same column, or same diagonal). 
 * There are many possible solutions. Write a program that displays one such solution.
