/**
 * Algebra: solve linear equations
 * Write a method that solves the following 2 x 2 system of linear equations:
 * The method header is public static double[] linearEquation(double[][] a, double[] b) 
 * The method returns null if a00a11 - a01a10 is 0. 
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a00, a01, a10, a11, b0, and b1, and displays the result. 
 * If a00a11 - a01a10 is 0, report that “The equation has no solution.”
