 * Baby name popularity ranking
 * The popularity ranking of baby names from years 2001 to 2010 is downloaded from www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames and stored in files named babynameranking2001.txt, babynameranking2002.txt, . . . , babynameranking2010.txt. 
 * Each file contains one thousand lines. 
 * Each line contains a ranking, a boy’s name, number for the boy’s name, a girl’s name, and number for the girl’s name.
 * So, the boy’s name Jacob and girl’s name Isabella are ranked #1 and the boy’s name Ethan and girl’s name Sophia are ranked #2. 
 * 21,875 boys are named Jacob and 22,731 girls are named Isabella.
