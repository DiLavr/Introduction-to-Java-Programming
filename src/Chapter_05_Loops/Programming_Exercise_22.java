/**
 * Financial application: loan amortization schedule
 * The monthly payment for a given loan pays the principal and the interest. 
 * The monthly interest is computed by multiplying the monthly interest rate and the balance (the remaining principal). 
 * The principal paid for the month is therefore the monthly payment minus the monthly interest. 
 * Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount, number of years, and interest rate and displays the amortization schedule for the loan.
