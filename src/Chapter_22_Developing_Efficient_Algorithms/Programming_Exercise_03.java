/**
 * Pattern matching
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter two strings and tests whether the second string is a substring of the first string. 
 * Suppose the neighboring characters in the string are distinct. (Don’t use the indexOf method in the String class.) 
 * Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm. 
 * Your algorithm needs to be at least O(n) time.
