/**
 * Geometry: great circle distance
 * The great circle distance is the distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. 
 * Let (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) be the geographical latitude and longitude of two points.
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the latitude and longitude of two points on the earth in degrees 
 * and displays its great circle distance. The average earth radius is 6,371.01 km. 
 * Note that you need to convert the degrees into radians using the Math.toRadians method 
 * since the Java trigonometric methods use radians. The latitude and longitude degrees in the formula are for north and west. 
 * Use negative to indicate south and east degrees.
