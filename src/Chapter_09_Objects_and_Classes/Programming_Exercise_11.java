/**
 * Algebra: 2 x 2 linear equations
 * Design a class named LinearEquation for a 2 x 2 system of linear equations:
 * The class contains:
 * Private data fields a, b, c, d, e, and f. 
 * A constructor with the arguments for a, b, c, d, e, and f.
 * Six getter methods for a, b, c, d, e, and f.
 * A method named isSolvable() that returns true if ad - bc is not 0.
 * Methods getX() and getY() that return the solution for the equation. 
 * Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. 
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a, b, c, d, e, and f and displays the result. 
 * If ad - bc is 0, report that “The equation has no solution.”
