/**
 * Geometry: the Circle2D class
 * Define the Circle2D class that contains:
 * Two double data fields named x and y that specify the center of the circle with getter methods.
 * A data field radius with a getter method.
 * A no-arg constructor that creates a default circle with (0, 0) for (x, y) and 1 for radius.
 * A constructor that creates a circle with the specified x, y, and radius.
 * A method getArea() that returns the area of the circle.
 * A method getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the circle.
 * A method contains(double x, double y) that returns true if the specified point (x, y) is inside this circle (see Figure 10.21a).
 * A method contains(Circle2D circle) that returns true if the specified circle is inside this circle (see Figure 10.21b).
 * A method overlaps(Circle2D circle) that returns true if the specified circle overlaps with this circle (see Figure 10.21c).
 * Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. 
 * Write a test program that creates a Circle2D object c1 (new Circle2D(2, 2, 5.5)), displays its area and perimeter, and displays the result of c1.contains(3, 3), c1.contains(new Circle2D(4, 5, 10.5)), and c1.overlaps(new Circle2D(3, 5, 2.3)).
