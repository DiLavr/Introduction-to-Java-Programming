/**
 * Largest block
 * Given a square matrix with the elements 0 or 1, write a program to find a maximum square submatrix whose elements are all 1s. 
 * Your program should prompt the user to enter the number of rows in the matrix. 
 * The program then displays the location of the first element in the maximum square submatrix 
 * and the number of the rows in the submatrix. 
 * Your program should implement and use the following method to find the maximum square submatrix: 
 * public static int[] findLargestBlock(int[][] m)
 * The return value is an array that consists of three values. 
 * The first two values are the row and column indices for the first element in the submatrix, 
 * and the third value is the number of the rows in the submatrix.
