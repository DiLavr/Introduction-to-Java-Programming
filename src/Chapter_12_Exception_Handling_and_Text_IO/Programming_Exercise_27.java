/**
 * Replace words
 * Suppose you have a lot of files in a directory that contain words Exercisei_j, where i and j are digits. 
 * Write a program that pads a 0 before i if i is a single digit and 0 before j if j is a single digit. 
 * For example, the word Exercise2_1 in a file will be replaced by Exercise02_01. 
 * In Java, when you pass the symbol * from the command line, it refers to all files in the directory (see Supplement III.V). 
 * Use the following command to run your program.
