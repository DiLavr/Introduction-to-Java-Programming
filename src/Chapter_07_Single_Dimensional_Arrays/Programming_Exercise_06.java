/**
 * Revise Listing 5.15, PrimeNumber.java
 * Listing 5.15 determines whether a number n is prime by checking whether 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n/2 is a divisor. 
 * If a divisor is found, n is not prime. 
 * A more efficient approach is to check whether any of the prime numbers less than or equal to (square root)n can divide n evenly. 
 * If not, n is prime. 
 * Rewrite Listing 5.15 to display the first 50 prime numbers using this approach. 
 * You need to use an array to store the prime numbers and later use them to check whether they are possible divisors for n.
