/**
 * Split files
 * Suppose you want to back up a huge file (e.g., a 10-GB AVI file) to a CD-R. 
 * You can achieve it by splitting the file into smaller pieces and backing up these pieces separately. 
 * Write a utility program that splits a large file into smaller ones using the following command:
 * java Exercise17_10 SourceFile numberOfPieces
 * The command creates the files SourceFile.1, SourceFile.2, . . . , SourceFile.n, where n is numberOfPieces and the output files are about the same size.
