/**
 * Geometry: intersecting point
 * Suppose two line segments intersect. 
 * The two endpoints for the first line segment are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and for the second line segment are (x3, y3) and (x4, y4). 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter these four endpoints and displays the intersecting point. 
 * As discussed in Programming Exercise 3.25, the intersecting point can be found by solving a linear equation. 
 * Use the LinearEquation class in Programming Exercise 9.11 to solve this equation.
