/**
 * Rename files
 * Suppose you have a lot of files in a directory named Exercisei_j, where i and j are digits. 
 * Write a program that pads a 0 before i if i is a single digit. 
 * For example, a file named Exercise2_1 in a directory will be renamed to Exercise02_1. 
 * In Java, when you pass the symbol * from the command line, it refers to all files in the directory (see Supplement III.V). 
 * Use the following command to run your program. 
 * java Exercise12_28 *
