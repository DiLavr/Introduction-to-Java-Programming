/**
 * Display calendars
 * Rewrite the PrintCalendar class in Listing 6.12 to display a calendar for a specified month using the Calendar and GregorianCalendar classes. 
 * Your program receives the month and year from the command line. For example:
 * java Exercise13_04 5 2016
 * You also can run the program without the year. 
 * In this case, the year is the current year. 
 * If you run the program without specifying a month and a year, the month is the current month.
