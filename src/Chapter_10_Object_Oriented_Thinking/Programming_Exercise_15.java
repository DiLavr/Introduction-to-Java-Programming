/**
 * Geometry: the bounding rectangle
 * A bounding rectangle is the minimum rectangle that encloses a set of points in a two-dimensional plane, as shown in Figure 10.24d. 
 * Write a method that returns a bounding rectangle for a set of points in a two-dimensional plane, as follows: 
 * public static MyRectangle2D getRectangle(double[][] points) 
 * The Rectangle2D class is defined in Programming Exercise 10.13. 
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter five points and displays the bounding rectangle’s center, width, and height.
