/**
 * Restore objects from a file
 * Suppose a file named Exercise17_07.dat has been created using the ObjectOutputStream. 
 * The file contains Loan objects. 
 * The Loan class in Listing 10.2 does not implement Serializable. 
 * Rewrite the Loan class to implement Serializable. 
 * Write a program that reads the Loan objects from the file and displays the total loan amount. 
 * Suppose you don’t know how many Loan objects are there in the file, use EOFException to end the loop.
