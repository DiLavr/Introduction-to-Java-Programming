/**
 * Game: craps
 * Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos. 
 * Write a program to play a variation of the game, as follows: 
 * Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, …, and 6, respectively.
 * Check the sum of the two dice. 
 * If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you lose; 
 * if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win; 
 * if the sum is another value (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established. 
 * Continue to roll the dice until either a 7 or the same point value is rolled. 
 * If 7 is rolled, you lose. Otherwise, you win.
