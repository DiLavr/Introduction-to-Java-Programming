/**
 * The Octagon class
 * Write a class named Octagon that extends GeometricObject and implements the Comparable and Cloneable interfaces. 
 * Assume that all eight sides of the octagon are of equal length. 
 * The area can be computed using the following formula:
 * Draw the UML diagram that involves Octagon, GeometricObject, Comparable, and Cloneable. 
 * Write a test program that creates an Octagon object with side value 5 and displays its area and perimeter. 
 * Create a new object using the clone method and compare the two objects using the compareTo method.
