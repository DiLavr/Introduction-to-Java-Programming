/**
 * Game: find the flipped cell
 * Suppose you are given a 6-by-6 matrix filled with 0s and 1s. 
 * All rows and all columns have an even number of 1s. Let the user flip one cell (i.e., flip from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1) 
 * and write a program to find which cell was flipped. 
 * Your program should prompt the user to enter a 6-by-6 array with 0s and 1s and find the first row r 
 * and first column c where the even number of the 1s property is violated (i.e., the number of 1s is not even). 
 * The flipped cell is at (r, c).
