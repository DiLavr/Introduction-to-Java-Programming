/**
 * Geometry: area of a triangle
 * Write a method that returns the area of a triangle using the following header: 
 * public static double getTriangleArea(double[][] points) 
 * The points are stored in a 3-by-2 two-dimensional array points with points[0][0] and points[0][1] for (x1, y1). 
 * The triangle area can be computed using the formula in Programming Exercise 2.19. 
 * The method returns 0 if the three points are on the same line. 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter three points of a triangle and displays the triangle's area.
