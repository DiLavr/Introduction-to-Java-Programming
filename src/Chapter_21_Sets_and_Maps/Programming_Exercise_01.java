 * Perform Set Operations on Hash Sets
 * Create two linked hash sets {"George", "Jim", "John", "Blake", "Kevin", "Michael"} 
 * and {"George", "Katie", "Kevin", "Michelle", "Ryan"} and find their union, difference, and intersection. 
 * (You can clone the sets to preserve the original sets from being changed by these set methods.)
