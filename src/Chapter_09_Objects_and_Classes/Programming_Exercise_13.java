 * The class contains public data fields row, column, and maxValue that store the maximal value and its indices in a two-dimensional array with row and column as int types and maxValue as a double type. 
 * Write the following method that returns the location of the largest element in a two-dimensional array:
 * public static Location locateLargest(double[][] a)
 * The return value is an instance of Location.
