 * Write a program that pads a 0 before j if j is a single digit. 
 * For example, a file named Exercise2_1 in a directory will be renamed to Exercise2_01. 
 * In Java, when you pass the symbol * from the command line, it refers to all files in the directory (see Supplement III.V). 
 * Use the following command to run your program. java Exercise12_29 *
