 * Random points on a circle
 * Write a program that generates three random points on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40 
 * and display three angles in a triangle formed by these three points, as shown in Figure 4.7a. 
 * (Hint: Generate a random angle a in radians between 0 and 2p, as shown in Figure 4.7b 
 * and the point determined by this angle is (r*cos(a), r*sin(a)).)
