/**
 * Mersenne prime
 * A prime number is called a Mersenne prime if it can be written in the form 2p - 1 for some positive integer p. 
 * Write a program that finds all Mersenne primes with p … 100 and displays the output as shown below. 
 * (Hint: You have to use BigInteger to store the number, because it is too big to be stored in long. Your program may take several hours to run.)
