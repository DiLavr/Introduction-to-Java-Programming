/**
 * Geometry: intersecting point
 * Write a method that returns the intersecting point of two lines. 
 * The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by using the formula shown in Programming Exercise 3.25. 
 * Assume that (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the two points on line 1 and (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) are on line 2. 
 * The method header is public static double[] getIntersectingPoint(double[][] points) 
 * The points are stored in a 4-by-2 two-dimensional array points with (points[0][0], points[0][1]) for (x1, y1). 
 * The method returns the intersecting point or null if the two lines are parallel. 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays the intersecting point.
