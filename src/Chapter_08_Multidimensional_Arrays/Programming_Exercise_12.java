/**
 * Financial application: compute tax
 * Rewrite Listing 3.5, ComputeTax.java, using arrays. For each filing status, there are six tax rates. 
 * Each rate is applied to a certain amount of taxable income. 
 * For example, from the taxable income of $400,000 for a single filer, 
 * $8,350 is taxed at 10%, (33,950 - 8,350) at 15%, (82,250 - 33,950) at 25%, (171,550 - 82,550) at 28%, (372,550 - 82,250) at 33%, 
 * and (400,000 - 372,950) at 36%. The six rates are the same for all filing statuses, 
 * which can be represented in the following array: 
 * double[] rates = {0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.28, 0.33, 0.35};
